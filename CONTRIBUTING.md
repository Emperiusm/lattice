## AI-First Development Model

Lattice uses an AI-first development model:
- AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) do the coding and implementation
- Human maintainers provide oversight, specs, and review
- GitHub Issues are the interface between humans and AI

See docs/ai-development/AGENT_GUIDE.md for the full workflow.
